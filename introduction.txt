Hello and welcome to one of my personal projects: the stockwatch web application
where I will attempt to build a responsive web app that updates live stockmarket
prices and analyzes historical data and tries to predict the next movement of the
stock!

Keyfeatures and skills that I will learn:

Real-time Stock data
- WebSockets, APIs
Historical Data Analysis
- Python

Prediction Engine
- Unknown

Backend
- FastAPI

Frontend Web App:
- React + TypeScript

Deployment
- Docker

This project will take place early May to late June 2025 as I am aiming to take my BSc examination
in computer science 2025. For continious support and guide, google and ChatGPT will be my friend
